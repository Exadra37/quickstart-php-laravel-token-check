# Approov Token Quickstart

This quickstart is for developers familiar with the PHP Laravel framework who are looking for a quick intro into how they can add [Approov](https://approov.io) into an existing project. Therefore this will guide you through the necessary steps for adding Approov to an existing PHP Laravel API server.

## How it works?

For more background, see the overview in the [README](/README.md#how-it-works) at the root of this repo.

The main functionality for the Approov token check is in the [Approov Middleware](/src/approov-protected-server/token-check/hello/app/Http/Middleware/Approov.php) class. Take a look at the `verifyApproovToken()` function to see the simple code for the check.

## Requirements

To complete this quickstart you will need both the PHP and the Approov CLI tool installed.

* PHP - Follow the official installation instructions from [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) to install a version equal or greater then `7.2.5`
* Approov CLI - Follow our [installation instructions](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-installation/#approov-tool) and read more about each command and its options in the [documentation reference](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/)

## Approov Setup

To use Approov with the PHP Laravel API server we need a small amount of configuration. First, Approov needs to know the API domain that will be protected. Second, the PHP Laravel API server needs the Approov Base64 encoded secret that will be used to verify the tokens generated by the Approov cloud service.

### Configure API Domain

Approov needs to know the domain name of the API for which it will issue tokens.

Add it with:

```text
approov api -add your.api.domain.com
```

Adding the API domain also configures the [dynamic certificate pinning](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-dynamic-pinning) setup, out of the box.

> **NOTE:** By default the pin is extracted from the public key of the leaf certificate served by the domain, as visible to the box executing the Approov CLI command and the Approov servers.

### Approov Secret

Approov tokens are signed with a symmetric secret. To verify tokens, we need to grab the secret using the [Approov secret command](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-cli-tool-reference/#secret-command) and plug it into the PHP Laravel API server environment to check the signatures of the [Approov Tokens](https://www.approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#approov-tokens) that it processes.

Retrieve the Approov secret with:

```text
approov secret -get base64
```

> **NOTE:** The `approov secret` command requires an [administration role](https://approov.io/docs/latest/approov-usage-documentation/#account-access-roles) to execute successfully.

#### Set the Approov Secret

Open the `.env` file and add the Approov secret to the var:

```text
APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET=approov_base64_secret_here
```

Now, let your Laravel app load it into the config, by creating a configuration file for Approov at `config/approov.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
    'secret' => base64_decode(env('APPROOV_BASE64_SECRET'), true),
];
```

## Approov Token Check

To check the Approov token we will use the [firebase/php-jwt](https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt) package, but you are free to use another one of your preference.

First, add the dependency to your project with:

```text
composer require firebase/php-jwt
```

Next, add the [Approov Middleware](/src/approov-protected-server/token-check/hello/app/Http/Middleware/Approov.php) class to your project at `app/Http/Middleware/Approov.php`:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Firebase\JWT\JWT;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\HeaderBag;

class Approov
{
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @param  \Closure  $next
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $approov_token_claims = $this->verifyApproovToken($request->headers);

        if (!$approov_token_claims) {
            return response()->json(new \stdClass(), 401);
        }

        return $next($request);
    }

    /**
     * Verifies the Approov token in the incoming request.
     *
     * Returns the Approov token claims on success or null on failure.
     *
     * @param  Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\HeaderBag  $headers
     * @return ?\stdClass
     */
    private function verifyApproovToken(HeaderBag $headers): ?\stdClass {
        try {
            $approov_token = $headers->get('Approov-Token');

            if (empty($approov_token)) {
                // You may want to add some logging here
                // \Log::debug("MISSING APPROOV TOKEN");
                return null;
            }

            $approov_secret = config('approov.secret');

            if (empty($approov_secret)) {
                // You may want to add some logging here
                //\Log::debug("MISSIG APPROOV SECRET");
                return null;
            }

            $approov_token_claims = JWT::decode($approov_token, $approov_secret, ['HS256']);
            return $approov_token_claims;

        } catch(\UnexpectedValueException $exception) {
            // You may want to add some logging here
            // \Log::debug($exception->getMessage());
            return null;
        } catch(\InvalidArgumentException $exception) {
            // You may want to add some logging here
            // \Log::debug($exception->getMessage());
            return null;
        } catch(\DomainException $exception) {
            // You may want to add some logging here
            // \Log::debug($exception->getMessage());
            return null;
        }

        // You may want to add some logging here
        return null;
    }
}
```

> **NOTE:** When the Approov token validation fails we return a `401` with an empty body, because we don't want to give clues to an attacker about the reason the request failed, and you can go even further by returning a `400`.

Now, add the [Approov Middleware](/src/approov-protected-server/token-check/hello/app/Http/Middleware/Approov.php) to your Laravel application route middleware array at [app/Http/Kernel.php](/src/approov-protected-server/token-check/hello/app/Http/Kernel.php):

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    'approov' => \App\Http\Middleware\Approov::class,
    'auth' => \App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
    // omitted lines for brevity
];
```

In the same file, you need to activate the Approov Middleware by including it as the first one in the array for the `api` route middleware group:

```php
protected $middlewareGroups = [
    'web' => [
        // omitted lines for brevity
    ],

    'api' => [
        'approov',
        'throttle:60,1',
        \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
    ],
];
```

> **NOTE:** The Approov middleware is included as the first one in the array because you don't want to waste your server resources in processing requests that don't have a valid Approov token. This approach will help your server to handle more load under a Denial of Service(DoS) attack.

Adding the Approov Middleware class to the `api` middleware group means that any incoming request to an API route needs to have a valid Approov token to be further processed. So, no need to explicitly add Approov as a middleware into any route in the file `routes/api.php`.

You can skip the Approov Middleware execution for any given route by using:

```php
Route::get('/some-route', function () {
    // your code here
})->withoutMiddleware(['approov']);
```

A full working example for a simple Hello World server can be found at [src/approov-protected-server/token-check](/src/approov-protected-server/token-check).

## Test your Approov Integration

The following examples below use cURL, but you can also use the [Postman Collection](/README.md#testing-with-postman) to make the API requests. Just remember that you need to adjust the urls and tokens defined in the collection to match your deployment. Alternatively, the above README also contains instructions for using the preset _dummy_ secret to test your Approov integration.

#### With Valid Approov Tokens

Generate a valid token example from the Approov Cloud service:

```text
approov token -genExample your.api.domain.com
```

Then make the request with the generated token:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The request should be accepted. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

...

{"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

#### With Invalid Approov Tokens

Generate an invalid token example from the Approov Cloud service:

```text
approov token -type invalid -genExample your.api.domain.com
```

Then make the request with the generated token:

```text
curl -i --request GET 'https://your.api.domain.com' \
  --header 'Approov-Token: APPROOV_INVALID_TOKEN_EXAMPLE_HERE'
```

The above request should fail with an Unauthorized error. For example:

```text
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

...

{}
```
